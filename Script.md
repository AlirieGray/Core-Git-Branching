## Plot

Evan woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
Evan checks his mail as he eats his typical breakfast of toast and an egg. He has received a strange note from a man who calls himself Gary Gygax. After his breakfast, he left for school, a little puzzled.
Normally Evan would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of Evan’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly. It was chilly out.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
Evan had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally Evan would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape. Last week, a weretiger had escaped and wreaked havoc on the city.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the of the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Evan met the Unicorn King who granted him magic powers. Then Gary Gygax shows up on a bronze dragon and lays waste to the zoo. With his new magic powers, Evan helps the Unicorn King defeat Gary Gygax and slay his dragon.
The end.
